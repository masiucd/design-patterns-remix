# Rust apps 🛠️

This repository contains a collection of Rust apps that I've written. They are mostly for learning purposes.

## Apps

- [✅] [Read files app] - A simple app that reads files from a directory and prints their contents to the console. Both text, json, csv and binary files are supported.
- [❌] [Quiz app] - A simple quiz app that reads questions from a csv file and asks them to the user. The user can choose between multiple choice and true/false questions.
- [✅] [Guessing game] - A simple guessing game that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. The user is given hints if the guess is too high or too low.
- [] [Personal card] - A simple app that prints a personal card to the console.
