# Rust apps üõ†Ô∏è

This repository contains a collection of Rust apps that I've written. They are mostly for learning purposes.

## Apps

- [] [Read files app] - A simple app that reads files from a directory and prints their contents to the console. Both text, json, csv and binary files are supported.
- [] [Quiz app] - A simple quiz app that reads questions from a csv file and asks them to the user. The user can choose between multiple choice and true/false questions.
